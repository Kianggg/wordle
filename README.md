# Wordle in JavaScript

This is a simple implementation of the web game Wordle.
I have another version in my repositories that uses React.

The program fetches a random word from an imported dictionary every time you play.

# JavaScript Games

I think it's fun to make small web games in JavaScript.
Last year I put this quick game together so my friends could have fun trying to guess which "Top 9 Favorite Games" list belonged to who.
